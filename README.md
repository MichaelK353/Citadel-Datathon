# Citadel-Europe-Datathon
This repository contains the project I worked on along with three others for the week long European Regional Datathon 2021. The project won __third place__. The project examines aspects of the Upworthy Research Archive. My contribution focused on time-series analysis of CTR over time.  

The main files in the repository are:
- *Team_3_report*: Our full report of the project.
- *Team_3_summary_poster*: An infographic detailing some of the main aspects of the project.
- *Citadel_Datathon_Code*: The main body of code used to produce the analysis. Worked on collaboratively. Much of the more datailed analysis and modelling is found in seperate files. The significant time constraints of the project made things somewhat messy!

The code used to produce my own contribution can be found in the files:
- *Datathon Code*: Main body of code used to produce my analysis.
- *ARIMA-GARCH Estimation*: A short script used to produce estimates of model coefficients. 

I have also included a short personal summary detailing the challenging aspects of the project, my solutions, areas of interest for further research, and things I have learned from the project. This was produced after the project was submitted. The file name is *Personal_Summary_of_Project*.
